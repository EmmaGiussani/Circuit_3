This is an experiment from my university lab II course, but I have decided to keep it separate due to an anomalous phenomenon. I attribute this phenomenon to a lack of calibration of the probe used, resulting in a decoupling of the RC-RC circuit. If you are interested and would like to contribute to understanding it, please check it out [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1aPZgYXlM8uyRFpaK1lZPjNYqT5P74Se5/view?usp=drivesdk).
