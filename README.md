## Circuit 3
This is an experiment from my university lab II course, in the first part we studied the transfer functions in RC and RL circuits and, then, the transfer functions in RLC circuits. I have decided to keep it separate from the other experiences of lab II due to an anomalous phenomenon in RL circuit. I attribute this phenomenon to a lack of calibration of the probe used, resulting in a decoupling of the RC-RC circuit. If you are interested and would like to contribute to understanding it, please check it out [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1aPZgYXlM8uyRFpaK1lZPjNYqT5P74Se5/view?usp=drivesdk).

>The reason why there's a difference between the published script and the research mentioned is because we worked on this project as a group, so we divided the tasks among us. We'll try to create a collaboration soon to give you the full project.
